# Today's To Do's App

This app is a daily to do list to help user keep track of everything they need to accomplish for the day.

## Lessons Learned

This app took me three days to create and a lot of googling when it came to the javascript side of things. I didn't want to fall on YouTube tutorials to work through this project, I wanted to complete it on my own, without a guide. So I utilized StackOverflow (a lot), w3schools.com, and GeeksForGeeks.org. I gained a better understanding of the differences between innerHTML, innerText, and textContent, and I learned how to target individual element using the click event.

## Tech Stack

The tools used to complete this project include: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
